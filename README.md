This project is a Visual Studio solution that contains various C++ projects.

## Contents
+ CPPSandbox
  * Used as a sandbox to experiment with various C++ concepts.
+ WindowMover
  * A console application that resizes and moves a specified window. This 
    project was created in order to allow exact positioning of a window on an
    ultrawide monitor. While window-snapping works well, the window will expand
    to fill the entire region that it's snapped to. This program works like
    window-snapping, but it allows you to specify the exact size and position
    of the window.
